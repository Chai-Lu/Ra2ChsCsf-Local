Add Chinese (Simplified) Translation
---

This pull request completes the Simplified Chinese translation, building upon early work by @DeathFishAtEase and refined by the RA2DIY community.

The update includes:
- A full translation of `Translation.ini` (excluding `Client:DTAConfig:TS*`).
- Localized UI images, including interface elements, settings, map names, and descriptions with optimized line breaks.
- Translated in-game content such as cameo assets, `ra2(md).csf`, and `subtitle(md).txt`.

The translation was developed with careful consideration for official Traditional Chinese translations, legacy text corrections, and established community terminology from historical articles, encyclopedias, and competitive play. It also incorporates documentation practices and interface localization experiences from the Chinese modder community, with input from multiple community contributors.

  <summary>Our detailed localization approach</summary>
  Key considerations during localization:
  - Adapted official Traditional Chinese translations to Simplified Chinese conventions, going beyond mere character conversion.
  - Corrected grammatical errors in legacy CSF texts and fixed typos in icons
  - Established terminology from historical articles in Chinese player communities
    - Competition conventions developed over many years
    - Communication methods formed through word-of-mouth (with no critical errors)
    - Descriptions long-used on encyclopedia sites
    - Some enthusiasts from the PvP community provided us with suggestions and materials. We appreciate their help!
  - Documentation practices from Chinese modder communities
    - Foundational tutorial documents
    - Online resources, translations, and technical discussion records
    - Chinese modders' interface localization experience sharing for their own mods
    - Contributors from Ares Community Chinese Docs, Phobos Community Chinese Docs, and Phobos Official Chinese Docs also participated in this project, providing guidance.

  We conducted an open vote and collected opinions on the translation content on the [RA2DIY forum](https://bbs.ra2diy.com/), and also held extensive discussions and critical feedback in the [Phobos Chinese User Community group](http://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&amp;k=f_h7TZoVX_8--ZedVFBMmjRrLBIzjMKJ&amp;authKey=QfNyW4DZUFqL3ZKzGL5PgLUWTnISj0myWn4WGtPPQmi3F%2FP3vfnuBd3YjLFk%2BU94&amp;noverify=0&amp;group_code=630590659).

  Moreover, we also contacted many original authors of maps created by Chinese enthusiasts, sought their opinions and gave careful consideration, avoiding issues such as 'Export to domestic sales'.
