Translation Enhancement: Chinese (Simplified)

Based on the early work by @DeathFishAtEase , this pull request has been refined and completed by the Chinese RA2DIY community. 

This update includes:

📄 Complete translation of `Translation.ini` (excluding `Client:DTAConfig:TS*` section).
🖼️ Localized UI images covering interface elements, settings items, map names & descriptions, with optimized line breaks.
🎮 Translated in-game content: cameo assets, `ra2(md).csf`, and `subtitle(md).txt`.

Key considerations during localization:
- Adapted official Traditional Chinese translations to Simplified Chinese conventions, going beyond mere character conversion.
- Corrected grammatical errors in legacy CSF texts and fixed typos in icons
- Established terminology from historical articles in Chinese player communities
  - Competition conventions developed over many years
  - Communication methods formed through word-of-mouth (with no critical errors)
  - Descriptions long-used on encyclopedia sites
  - Some enthusiasts from the PvP community provided us with suggestions and materials. We appreciate their help!
- Documentation practices from Chinese modder communities
  - Foundational tutorial documents
  - Online resources, translations, and technical discussion records
  - Chinese modders' interface localization experience sharing for their own mods
  - Contributors from Ares Community Chinese Docs, Phobos Community Chinese Docs, and Phobos Official Chinese Docs also participated in this project, providing guidance.
- *Chinese Copywriting Guidelines*

We conducted an open vote and collected opinions on the translation content on the [RA2DIY forum](https://bbs.ra2diy.com/), and also held extensive discussions and critical feedback in the [Phobos Chinese User Community group](http://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&amp;k=f_h7TZoVX_8--ZedVFBMmjRrLBIzjMKJ&amp;authKey=QfNyW4DZUFqL3ZKzGL5PgLUWTnISj0myWn4WGtPPQmi3F%2FP3vfnuBd3YjLFk%2BU94&amp;noverify=0&amp;group_code=630590659).

Moreover, we also contacted many original authors of maps created by Chinese enthusiasts, sought their opinions and gave careful consideration, avoiding issues such as 'Export to domestic sales'.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to rendering limitations in the client, some map descriptions may display unexpected line breaks at certain resolutions. These are not manually added in translation files.

Please review and suggest any required adjustments. Thank you for your collaboration.
