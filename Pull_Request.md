Add Chinese (Simplified) Translation
---

This pull request completes the Simplified Chinese translation, building upon early work by @DeathFishAtEase and refined by the RA2DIY community.

The update includes:
- A full translation of `Translation.ini` (excluding `Client:DTAConfig:TS*`).
- Localized UI images, including interface elements, settings, map names, and descriptions with optimized line breaks.
- Translated in-game content such as cameo assets, `ra2(md).csf`, and `subtitle(md).txt`.

The translation was developed with careful consideration for official Traditional Chinese translations, legacy text corrections, and established community terminology from historical articles, encyclopedias, and competitive play. It also incorporates documentation practices and interface localization experiences from the Chinese modder community, with input from multiple community contributors.

  <summary>Our detailed localization approach</summary>

  Key considerations during localization:
  - Adapted official Traditional Chinese in-game translations to Simplified Chinese, going beyond simple character conversion.
  - Corrected grammatical errors in legacy CSF texts and fixed typos in icons.
  - Carefully-chosen terminology using established community standards and historical usage:
    - Longstanding player conventions from years of competitive play.
    - Common terms and slang that have spread through word-of-mouth in the community.
    - Long-used descriptions on fan-made encyclopedia sites.
    - We also received valuable suggestions on map names from enthusiasts in the PvP community. We appreciate their help!
  - Incorporated documentation practices from Chinese modder communities:
    - Referencing tutorial documents, online resources, and technical discussion records.
    - Referencing other Chinese modders' experiences with the CnCNet client localization.
    - Receiving guidance from contributors to the Ares and Phobos Chinese Docs communities.
    - Holding extensive discussions and critical feedback sessions in the Phobos Chinese User Community group.
  - Adhered to the [*Chinese Copywriting Guidelines*](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines).
